# Aparecium
Harry Potter fans: ever wondered if the characters supporting evil really were all from Slytherin? Or which house is more welcoming of children with non-magical parents? Or from which houses Ministry of Magic employees are recruited? 

Aparecium takes information from the [Harry Potter API](https://www.potterapi.com/) and visualises it using D3.

## Where's the title from?
Aparecium is the [revealing charm](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Revealing_Charm) - this site aims to reveal information about characters in the series.
